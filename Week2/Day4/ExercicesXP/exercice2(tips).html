            /*John created a simple tip calculator to help calculate how much to tip when he and his family go to restaurants.

              Create a function named calculateTip() that takes no parameter.

              Inside the function, ask John for the amount of the bill.

              Here are the rules
              If the bill is less than $50, tip 20%.
              If the bill is between $50 and $200, tip 15%.
              If the bill is more than $200, tip 10%.

              Console.log the tip amount and the final bill (bill + tip).

              Call the calculateTip() function.*/
